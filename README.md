# re-frame-firebase

[Re-frame](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame) wrapper around Google's
[Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) database.


## Overview

There are already several ClojureScript wrappers of Firebase, most notably
[Matchbox](https://github.com/crisptrutski/matchbox). However, I was not able to find
any that work with recent version of Firebase, nor that smoothly integrate with
re-frame.

Re-frame-firebase is based on ideas, and some code, from Timothy Pratley's [blog
post](http://timothypratley.blogspot.co.il/2016/07/reacting-to-changes-with-firebase-and.html)
and [VoterX](https://github.com/timothypratley/voterx) project. I've added the packaging
as a standalone project, the integration with re-frame and, I'm sure, any mistakes that
I've not yet caught.

_Note: This project is under active development, and exists primarily to meet my immediate
needs. Therefore, many Firebase features are still missing. I will probably only add
them as I need. But, I am receptive to feature requests and happy to accept PRs._

## Configuration

[![Clojars Project](https://img.shields.io/clojars/v/com.degel/re-frame-firebase.svg)](https://clojars.org/com.degel/re-frame-firebase)
[![Dependencies Status](https://versions.deps.co/deg/re-frame-firebase/status.svg)](https://versions.deps.co/deg/re-frame-firebase)

- Add this project to your dependencies. The current version is
  `[com.degel/re-frame-firebase "0.7.0"]`. Note this automatically includes firebase
  too; currently v5.0.4-1.
- Reference the main namespace in your code: `[com.degel.re-frame-firebase :as firebase]`
- Initialize the library in your app initialization, probably just before you call
  `(mount-root)`. See below for details.

## Usage

The public portions of the API are all in
[re\_frame\_firebase.cljs](src/com/degel/re_frame_firebase.cljs). That file also
includes API documentation that may sometimes be more current or complete than
what is here.

This is a re-frame API. It is primarily accessed through re-frame events and
subscriptions.

### Initialization

Initialize the library in your app initialization, probably just before you call `(mount-root)`.


```clojure
;;; From https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/project/trilystro/overview - "Add Firebase to your web app"
(defonce firebase-app-info
  {:apiKey "YOUR-KEY-HERE"
   :authDomain "YOUR-APP.firebaseapp.com"
   :databaseURL "https://YOUR-APP.firebaseio.com"
   :storageBucket "YOUR-APP.appspot.com"})

(defn ^:export init []
  ,,,
  (firebase/init :firebase-app-info      firebase-app-info
                 ; See: https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/js/firebase.firestore.Settings
                 :firestore-settings     {:timestampsInSnapshots true}
                 :get-user-sub           [:user]
                 :set-user-event         [:set-user]
                 :default-error-handler  [:firebase-error])
  ,,,
)

```

This initialization does two things:

1. It supplies your Firebase credentials to this library
2. It defines several callbacks to your project from the library

#### Credentials

You need to create your Firebase project on its
[site](https://firebase.google.com). This will supply you with a set of credentials: an
API key, domain, URL, and bucket. Mimicking the sample above, copy these into your code.

Note that it is ok to have these credentials visible in your client-side code. But, you
must configure Firebase rules to safely control access to your database.

#### Callbacks

This library relies on your code to implement two behaviors:
- Storing the user object
- Reporting errors

It communicates with your code via three callbacks that you define in `firebase/init`:
`:get-user-sub`, `:set-user-event`, and `:default-error-handler`. The first of these is
normally a re-frame subscription vector, while the latter two are re-frame event
vectors. As is typical in re-frame, info will be passed by appending it to the the vector.

Note that re-frame-firebase uses the [Iron](https://github.com/deg/iron) library,
which supports passings functions instead of re-frame subscriptions or events. Each of
these callbacks can, therefore, also be plain functions.

For more details, e.g. the parameters passed to each callback, see the documentation in
the [source](src/com/degel/re_frame_firebase.cljs).

You can also see some sample code in my toy project
[trilystro](https://github.com/deg/trilystro). But, tread carefully here, this is my
experimental stomping ground and things may be broken at any time.


### Authentication

Firebase supports a variety of user authentication mechanisms. Currently,
re-frame-firebase supports the following Firebase authentication providers:
 - Google
 - Facebook
 - Twitter
 - GitHub
 - Email/password

(PRs welcome that add to this!)

Before an authentication provider can be used, it has to be enabled and configured in
the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/) (Authentication ->
Sign-in method section).

You need to write three events: two to handle login and logout requests from your views,
and and one to store the user information returned to you from the library. You also
need to write a subscription to return the user information to the library.  For
example:

```clojure
;;; Simple sign-in event. Just trampoline down to the re-frame-firebase
;;; fx handler.
(re-frame/reg-event-fx
 :sign-in
 (fn [_ _] {:firebase/google-sign-in {:sign-in-method :popup}}))


;;; Ditto for sign-out
(re-frame/reg-event-fx
 :sign-out
 (fn [_ _] {:firebase/sign-out nil}))


;;; Store the user object
(re-frame/reg-event-db
 :set-user
 (fn [db [_ user]]
   (assoc db :user user)))

;;; A subscription to return the user to the library
(re-frame/reg-sub
  :user
  (fn [db _] (:user db)))

```

The user object contains several opaque fields used by the library and firebase,
and also several fields that may be useful for your application, including:

- `:display-name` - The user's full name
- `:email` - The user's email address
- `:photo-url` - The user's photo
- `:uid` - The user's unique id, used by Firebase. Helpful for setting up private areas in
  the db

#### Email Authentication

When using email/password authentication, one usually has to register first (the alternative
is to create an account using the [Firebase admin console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)).
So the application could provide both a means of registering a new user, and to log in as the
created user later on.
When registering a new user, you should use the `:firebase/email-create-user` effect.  If the
information is valid (e.g. the user does not exist already) then it will automatically trigger
a sign in.

For authenticating an already existing account, use the `:firebase/email-sign-in` effect.  Example:

```clojure
;;; Create a new user
(re-frame/reg-event-fx
 :create-by-email
 (fn [_ [_ email pass]]
 {:firebase/email-create-user {:email email :password pass}}))


;;; Sign in by email
(re-frame/reg-event-fx
 :sign-in-by-email
 (fn [_ [_ email pass]]
 {:firebase/email-sign-in {:email email :password pass}}))

```

The rest of the procedure is the same as for the OAuth methods.

### Anonymous Authentication

Anonymous authentication allows persisting of information before users sign up.

```clojure
;;; Create anonymous user
(re-frame/reg-event-fx
 :sign-in-anonymous
 (fn [_ _]
 {:firebase/anonymous-sign-in nil}))

```

### Custom Authentication

This relies on an external system to generate a JWT, signed with a
private key that is generate by Firebase. See [Firebase docs][custom-auth]
for details how to mint such a token.

[custom-auth]: https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/admin/create-custom-tokens

```clojure
;;; Sign in using a custom token
(re-frame/reg-event-fx
 :sign-in-custom
 (fn [_ _]
 {:firebase/custom-token-sign-in {:token "eyJhbGciOiJS.."}}))

```

### Phone Authentication

This sends an SMS to a cellphone, to authenticate against the number. One complication is
that a reCaptcha setup is required to avoid abuse. Only the invisible reCaptcha is implemented
at the moment.

See [Firebase docs][phone-auth] for details.

[phone-auth]: https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/phone-auth

```clojure
(re-frame/reg-event-fx
 ::init-captcha
 (fn [_ _]
   {:firebase/init-recaptcha {:on-solve     [:msg "Welcome Human"]
                              :container-id "sign-in-button"}}))


(re-frame/reg-event-fx
 ::phone-sign-in
 (fn [_ [_ phone]]
   {:firebase/phone-number-sign-in {:phone-number phone
                                    :on-send      [:msg "SMS code sent"]}}))


(re-frame/reg-event-fx
 ::phone-confirm-code
 (fn [_ [_ code]]
   {:firebase/phone-number-confirm-code {:code code}}))

```

### Writing to the database

The firebase database is a tree. You can write values to nodes in a tree, or push them
to auto-generated unique sub-nodes of a node.  In re-frame-firebase, these are exposed
through the `:firebase/write` and `:firebase/push` effect handlers.

Each takes parameters:
- `:path` - A vector representing a node in the firebase tree, e.g. `[:my :node]`
- `:value` - The value to write or push
- `:on-success` - Event vector or function to call when write succeeds.
- `:on-failure` - Event vector or function to call with the error.

Example:

```clojure
(re-frame/reg-event-fx
  :write-status
  (fn [{db :db} [_ status]]
    {:firebase/write {:path [:status]
                      :value status
                      :on-success #(js/console.log "Wrote status")
                      :on-failure [:handle-failure]}}))

;;; :firebase/push is treated the same but responds with the key of the created object

```

Example (diff in bold):

<pre>
(re-frame/reg-event-fx
  :write-status
  (fn [{db :db} [_ status]]
    {:firebase/<b>push</b> {:path [:status]
                      :value status
                      :on-success #(js/console.log <b>(str "New Status push key: " %)</b> )
                      :on-failure [:handle-failure]}}))
</pre>

> **Note:** Events will also receive the same creation key. `(rf/reg-event-fx :event-name (fn [ctx [_ key]])`


Re-frame-firebase also supplies `:firebase/multi` to allow multiple write and/or
pushes from a single event:

```
(re-frame/reg-event-fx
  :write-keyed-message
  (fn [{db :db} [_ message]]
    {:firebase/multi [[:firebase/write {:path [:latest-message] :value :message :on-,,,}]
                      [:firebase/push  {:path [:messages] :value :message :on-,,,}]]}))
```

### Reading from the database

Firebase supports one-time reads of a node and also subscribing to a node to receive
updates anytime its content changes.  Both are supported by re-frame-firebase. (But,
note, we don't yet support all the subscription variatons offered by Firebase).

`firebase/read-once` handles one-time reads. Perhaps surprisingly, it is an event
handler, not a subscription. This is because a one-time read is a sink not a
source. Your application actively requests a value. The response then returns,
triggering another event. Conceptually, this is very much like an http request.

```clojure
(re-frame/reg-event-fx
  :read-motd
  (fn [{db :db} [_ status]]
    {:firebase/read-once {:path [:message-of-the-day]
                          :on-success [:got-motd]
                          :on-failure [:handle-failure]}}))
```

Firebase '`:on`' subscriptions are handled as re-frame subscriptions:

```clojure
(re-frame/subscribe [:firebase/on-value {:path [:latest-message]}])
```

The firebase subscription will remain active only while the re-frame subscription is
active. Effectively, this is when any variable bound to the subscription remains in
scope.

This, combined with re-frame 0.9's beautiful subscription caching leads to some very
nice behavior: If you want to subscribe to a re-frame value for a long period of time,
but want to access it deep inside a component, you can do this easily and efficiently by
subscribing twice to the same path. _(If you are not familiar with this area,
<https://github.com/Day8/re-frame/issues/218> is a useful read)_

You subscribe once in the outermost component of your page, which will, presumably,
never be reloaded. This causes the subsription to become and remain active.

You subcribe again within any component that wants to access the value. This causes
_zero_ extra work. The firebase subscription only happens once. Firebase pushes any
changes as they happen, precisely once per change. Re-frame-firebase caches the current
value locally. The subscriptions read the value from the local cache.

_Note well: It is not sufficient to just mention the subscription in the outer
component. You must actually use it in the component, so that it is embedded in a
mounted component._

_Internal detail: The values are currently cached in your app db, under the key
`com.degel.re-frame-firebase.core\cache`. But, this is an implementation detail, subject
to change. Please do not rely on this for anything except, perhaps, debugging._


### Monitoring connectivity

Your client's connection to the Firebase server may go down sometimes. You
can detect this by subscribing to `:firebase/connection-state`. This
subscription delivers a map, currently containing only one element:
`:firebase/connected`. Its value will be `true` when the connection is up and
`false` when down.

Firebase's web/javascript client does a good job of handling offline
conditions, so you can actually often ignore these state changes. For
example, database values are cached locally and can be read even when the
server is temporarily unaccessible.  Writes, however, are a bit
trickier. Firebase does cache and retry, but only while the client web page
is up. If your web page is closed, I think that any writes done while offline
will be lost. Therefore, it is advisable to check the connection state when
attempting a write. If the connection is down, you can warn the user or store
the results locally.
([re-frame-storage-fx](https://github.com/deg/re-frame-storage-fx)
may be useful for this).


### Firestore

[Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/) is a beta database included in
Firebase. re-frame-firebase exposes the Firestore SDK in a very similar way it does to
the Realtime Database.  It uses effects for most things, and a subscription for data.
However, Firestore has a more complex structuring of data and querying system, using
collections and documents.  Thus, more options are provided and the returned data has
more information attached to it besides a JSON object.

We replace/wrap all JS objects into clojure-style maps (using-hyphens instead of camelCase);
both the responses from Firestore and the parameters passed to it.

You can find a simple introduction through examples below, but all the options
are documented in [re\_frame\_firebase.cljs](src/com/degel/re_frame_firebase.cljs).

There are also some well-documented public functions in the beginning of
[firestore.cljs](src/com/degel/re_frame_firebase/firestore.cljs). Most users
won't find them useful except for understanding how re-frame-firebase interacts
with the Firebase SDK. However, if you find yourself needing to use Firestore's
JS objects directly, you might find those useful.

#### Set a document (`:firestore/set` effect)

You should provide a vector of keywords and/or strings representing the path
to the document under the `:path` argument. Also provide a clojure map representing
the document data under the `:data` argument.

```clojure
{:firestore/set {:path [:my-collection "my-document"]
                 :data {:field1 "value1"
                        :field2 {:inner1 "a" :inner2 "b"}}
                 :set-options {:merge false
                               :merge-fields [:field1 [:field2 :inner1]]}
                 :on-success [:success-event]
                 :on-failure #(prn "Error:" %)}}
```

#### Update a document (`:firestore/update` effect)

Works the same way as `:firestore/set`, except it doesn't take a `:set-options` parameter.

#### Delete a document (`:firestore/delete` effect)

Works the same way as `:firestore/set`, except it doesn't take `:data` and `:set-options` parameters.

#### Execute multiple write operations using Firestore's WriteBatch (`:firestore/write-batch` effect)

WriteBatches only support :firestore/set, :firestore/update and :firestore/delete.

You should provide a vector of effect maps for each of the wanted operations under
the `:operations` argument.

```clojure
{:firestore/batch-write
 {:operations
  [[:firestore/set {:path [:cities "SF"] :data {:name "San Francisco" :state "CA"}}]
   [:firestore/set {:path [:cities "LA"] :data {:name "Los Angeles" :state "CA"}}]
   [:firestore/set {:path [:cities "DC"] :data {:name "Washington, D.C." :state nil}}]]
  :on-success #(prn "Cities added to database.")
  :on-failure #(prn "Couldn't add cities to database. Error:" %)}}
```

Note you can also batch firestore effects through `:firebase/multi`. However,
`:firestore/write-batch` sends a single request to the server, thus it is faster.
`:firebase/multi`, on the other hand, supports all `:firestore` effects
(not only write ones), but it works by dispatching the effects individually.

#### Add a document to a Firestore collection (`:firestore/add` effect).

Works the same way as the previous effects, but `:on-success` will be provided
with a vector of strings representing the path to the created document.

```clojure
{:firestore/add {:path [:my-collection]
                 :data my-data
                 :on-success #(prn "Added document ID:" (last %))}}
```

#### Get a document or collection query from Firestore (`:firestore/get` effect).

You should provide a vector of keywords/strings representing the path under either
`:path-document` or `:path-collection`. The `:on-success` callback will be provided
with the query result as an argument. The data will be transformed into a clojure
object and the keys will be in clojure-style (using-hyphens instead of camelCase).

Querying is full of options. They are documented in full in
[re\_frame\_firebase.cljs](src/com/degel/re_frame_firebase.cljs).

```clojure
{:firestore/get {:path-document [:my-collection :my-document]
                 :expose-objects false
                 :on-success #(prn "Objects's contents:" (:data %))}}
```

```clojure
{:firestore/get {:path-collection [:cities]
                 :where [[:state :>= "CA"]
                         [:population :< 1000000]]
                 :limit 1000
                 :order-by [[:state :desc]
                            [:population :desc]]
                 :start-at ["CA" 1000]
                 :doc-changes false
                 :on-success #(prn "Number of documents:" (:size %))}}
```

#### Set up a listener for changes in a Firestore collection/document query (`:firestore/on-snapshot` effect)

You can use the `:firestore/on-snapshot` effect for this. It accepts most of
the arguments from `:firestore/get`. You should provide `:on-next` instead of
`:on-success`, which will be called every time a change happens with the retrieved
data as argument. You should pass `:on-error` instead of `:on-failure`.
(re-frame/reg-fx :firestore/on-snapshot firestore/on-snapshot-effect)

#### Subscribe to a Firestore collection/document query (`:firestore/on-snapshot` subscription)

Takes the same arguments as `:firestore/on-snapshot` effect, except for `:on-next`,
as it is meant to be used as a subscription.

```clojure
(re-frame/subscribe
  [:firestore/on-snapshot {:path-document [:my :document]}])
```


## Examples and projects

There are examples provided in the [examples](examples) folder. It is great to
check them in order to get used to the API.

I have a toy project, [Trilystro](https://github.com/deg/trilystro) which
uses re-frame-firebase. It is an evolving work, so I cannot offer any
guarantees that it will always be stable. But, I have tried to keep the code
reasonably clean and readable. It will also often be running at
<http://trilystro.vuagain.com>

## Setup

This is a library project. Although it still includes some of the Mies
templates's scaffolding for a standalone project, I have not used these
features and they may have decayed.

For development, I just include this project in the
[checkouts directory](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/blob/master/doc/TUTORIAL.md#checkout-dependencies)
of a project that uses it.

Then, for deployment, simply:

```
lein deploy clojars
```

_The rest of this section is Mies boilerplate. Probably all correct, but not necesarily relevant._

    Most of the following scripts require [rlwrap](http://utopia.knoware.nl/~hlub/uck/rlwrap/) (on OS X installable via brew).

    Build your project once in dev mode with the following script and then open `index.html` in your browser.

        ./scripts/build

    To auto build your project in dev mode:

        ./scripts/watch

    To start an auto-building Node REPL:

        ./scripts/repl

    To get source map support in the Node REPL:

        lein npm install

    To start a browser REPL:

    1. Uncomment the following lines in src/re_frame_firebase/core.cljs:
    ```clojure
    ;; (defonce conn
    ;;   (repl/connect "http://localhost:9000/repl"))
    ```
    2. Run `./scripts/brepl`
    3. Browse to `http://localhost:9000` (you should see `Hello world!` in the web console)
    4. (back to step 3) you should now see the REPL prompt: `cljs.user=>`
    5. You may now evaluate ClojureScript statements in the browser context.

    For more info using the browser as a REPL environment, see
    [this](https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript/wiki/The-REPL-and-Evaluation-Environments#browser-as-evaluation-environment).

    Clean project specific out:

        lein clean

    Build a single release artifact with the following script and then open `index_release.html` in your browser.

        ./scripts/release

## Questions

I can usually be found on the [Clojurians Slack](https://clojurians.net)
#reagent or #re-frame slack channels. My handle is @deg. Email is also fine,
or you can report issues or PRs directly to this project.
